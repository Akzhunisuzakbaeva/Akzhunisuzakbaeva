    <h2>Our Opproach</h2>
   <p class="in"><img class="im" src="images/uzo.png" >
One of the primary things that stand out about Parallax Global is our unique point-of-view and approach to consulting engagements.</p><p>
The lens through which we view every consulting engagement is a Parallax View, which of course, as the definition of "parallax" suggests, means that we take two alternate (but not necessarily opposing) views of every problem, and compare and contrast two alternate strategies for approaching the problem. This ensures that individuals, teams and management do not become victims of their own paradigms (read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions for more on this), that we don't get lazy, and that we can assure our clients of the deepest and most creative approaches to their problems, every time.
